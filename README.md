# Deni AI

> **AI Chatbot for Everyone** — access modern AI models in one place

Deni AI is a multi-model AI chat app for people who want strong model choice without juggling many separate subscriptions. It supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, xAI, and more via platform keys or bring-your-own-key (BYOK).

**Live app:** [https://deniai.app](https://deniai.app)

## Features

- **Multi-model chat** — switch between OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, xAI, and other routed models
- **BYOK** — connect your own provider API keys (encrypted at rest); BYOK usage is not counted against platform limits
- **Tools** — web search (Brave), page browse, image generation, and video (Veo) where enabled
- **Memory & projects** — personalization memories and project-scoped context for organized chats
- **Teams** — organizations, seats, and shared Pro access with usage visibility
- **Billing** — Stripe subscriptions (personal and team); optional self-host disable via `NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_DISABLED`
- **Auth** — Google / GitHub OAuth, magic link, anonymous guest, passkeys, and 2FA (better-auth)
- **i18n** — English and Japanese (`next-intl`)
- **PWA** — installable progressive web app assets and service worker
