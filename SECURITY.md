## Scope notes for researchers

In scope examples:

- Authentication / session issues
- Authorization bypasses (user, team, shared chat data)
- Injection, XSS, SSRF (including chat tools that fetch remote URLs)
- Secrets exposure or unsafe handling of BYOK keys
- Billing or usage-quota bypasses

Out of scope examples (unless they lead to a real vulnerability):

- Denial of service via volumetric traffic alone
- Issues that require physical access or already-compromised user credentials
- Reports based solely on missing non-security headers without impact
